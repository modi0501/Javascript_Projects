# Pig Game



## Game Rules:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach target points (set in the target score field) on GLOBAL score wins the game.
